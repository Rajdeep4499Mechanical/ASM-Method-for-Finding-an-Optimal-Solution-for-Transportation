# ASM-Method-for-Finding-an-Optimal-Solution-for-Transportation
 The goal is to study ASM method and to determine if ASM really delivers an optimal solution  directly. 
Traditional methods like Vogel’s method and MODI may require two steps or more to calculate Initial Best Feasible Solution (IBFS) and optimization.
In the research paper authors proposed a new method  "ASM Method“ which can directly provide an optimal solution without IBFS with less computation time than traditional methods.
Authors provided the general instructions on how to use ASM method and applied this method on the example provided in the research paper and calculated the solutions directly.
To validate the results if they were optimal or not , authors compared the solution with Vogel’s method and Modi Method. However, they directly wrote results from Modi method.
To understand the ASM method better, I have calculated the solution for the same given problem in research paper step by step.
 To validate if the ASM method provided optimal solution, I have used Excel (Simplex L.P. Solver).
